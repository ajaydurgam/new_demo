mWhat is ansible?
A. Ansible® is an open source IT automation tool that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other manual IT processes. Unlike more simplistic management tools, Ansible users (like system administrators, developers and architects) can use Ansible automation to install software, automate daily tasks, provision infrastructure, improve security and compliance, patch systems, and share automation across the entire organization.

How Ansible works?
Ansible works by connecting to what you want automated and pushing programs that execute instructions that would have been done manually. These programs utilize Ansible modules that are written based on the specific expectations of the endpoint’s connectivity, interface, and commands. Ansible then executes these modules (over standard SSH by default), and removes them when finished (if applicable).

There are no additional servers, daemons, or databases required. Typically you'll work with your favorite terminal program, a text editor, and a version control system to keep track of changes to your content. 

What is an Ansible playbook?
An Ansible playbook is a blueprint of automation tasks—which are complex IT actions executed with no need for human involvement. Ansible playbooks are written in human-readable YAML format and executed on a set, group, or classification of hosts, which together make up an Ansible inventory.


-->we have one master and two nodes(node1,node2)

--IN Master we will install asible but in nodes we wont do anything, through ansible we ill install all the applications in nodes.
--Master:
-we need to install asinle and pip3 pacakages.
-in master create a user:useradd ansibleuser, 
-in master create a password:passwd ansibleuser(password for anisbleuser)
-visudo for user: visudo-->
includedir /etc/sudoers.d
ansibleuser ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL

-su ansibleuser----enter into ansible user
-how to do password authentication-----cd /etc/ssh---> vi sshd_config----> type- /password---> un-comment passwordauthentication yes and comment passwordauthentication no---> and save it.
--->do same has in nodes(node1,node2)password authentication & sudo access
-----How to connect Master to Nodes with the help of SSH keys.
-----In Master login to asible user---> how to check hidden file and folders-->ls -la---->ssh-keygen--->ls -la will find the ssh key--->cd .ssh
ls -lrt to see private and pubild key--->we need to copy master ssh public&private key's in nodes--->exit-->systemctl restart sshd--->in all nodes to we have to do--->su -ansibleuser--->ssh-copy-id node1 node2--->

Inventory:
--------
Master--->cd /etc/ansible--->vi host---->and past the IP address of node's(1,2)--->and save it--->now test the node's it's working or not--->ansible all -m ping--->can we change hostfile name--->yes we can do it--->and aslo we can copy ansible.cfg file and we can work on it--->cd ansible--->vi ansible.cfg--->
inventory = /home/andibleuser/inventory--->save it--->ansible all -m ping----> touch /home/ansibleuser/inventory---->vi /home/ansibleuser/inventory and copy node ip address--->save it---->ls -lrt----> cp ansible.cfg /home/ansibleuser/---->vi /home/ansibleuser---->and remove the inventory line--->ls -lrt---> ansible all -m ping----->

What is ansible configuration?

A. it is ansible engine----connect to storage,linux,windows,docker container,networks,cloud,podman--->ansible is push mechanism---->ansible to linux Engin(interpetter)---->python--->ansible to windows(interpetter)---->powershell& .net(V4)
--->ansible to networks,cloud, docker container---->it will only push commands--->and code allways lies in Asible engin---->coming to ansible to linux or windows---> will push codes also--->cloud.network,container is devices---->windows&linux are OS---->

----->Asible Engin is controls nodes and windows,linux,storage,cloud,networks,container is mange nodes.
----controls nodes will connect to manges nodes with the help of inventory's(remote,host).

What is Playbooks?
A. it is yaml file and it will have sequence of place(sequence of task).
What is task?
A. Action plan's we call as modules()

Task?

A. Is a asible.cfg---->we have two session---->1. default 2.privilage_escalation

Dfault session---->default setting and also mention remote user's
Privalage_escalation----> How ansible run in mange hosts

---cd ansibleuser--->vi ~/.ansible.cfg and then inventory will take from here--->
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory----->save it----> ansible ---version---> it will show /root/.ansible.cfg
