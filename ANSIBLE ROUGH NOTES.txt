                                      **********ANSIBLE ROUGH NOTES**************



Ansible is agent less 


agent less means we dont need to install anything on the target folder to connect with the master



if we dont create any inventory file ansible uses default inventory file --> /etc/ansible/hosts



private ip address ansible_host=server1.company.com (it defines the ip address of the target)

ansible_connection=ssh --> it defines how master connects to the target folder

ansible_port-22/596

localhost ansible_connection=localhost

ansible_ssh_pass-password



================================================================================================================


connection with master to Target is done by using --> ssh Private ip of target node


if of one target node ping is successed but when pinging the another target its got failed 


at that time open --> vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 

check for host_key_checking=False (uncomment it)

Now its work 


================================================================================================================



                      **********YAML FILES**************


Yaml file is used to represent configuration data


Key Value data separated by ":"



indentation should be clear in Yaml files


Yaml file representations

dictionary in another dictionary 

lists


In Yaml file dictionaries doesn't need order but in arraylist order must be same in yaml file



==========================================================================================================================



                                     ************Playbooks*************


--> Run simple commands on target1 using master playbook

--> resarting target1 also done using playbooks,...etc

--> deploy 50 vm's on public cloud 

--> provision storage to all vm's

--> configuring web server to all ip's

--> set up cluster configuration 


these all and many more can be done using the playbooks.



===> playbook --> is a single yamlfile 

    
     play --> defines set of activities (tasks) to be run on hosts(targets)


      tasks --> 1.execute a command 

                2.run a script 

                3.install a package

                4.shutdown/restart



     
playbook divided into two set of dictionaries 


every dictinoary has a --> 1.name

                           2.hosts

                           3.tasks (it is in list form its a ordered collection)

    

modules are the different tasks done in yaml ex: command ,service ,yum ,shell



if we have a file in master node  the by using the modules 


==> ansible all -m ping(here ping is the module) -i(to specify inventory file)  inventory.txt

we can connect it to the target nodes



Playbook creation 


--> vi playbook.yml

        

  - 
     name: test connectivity to target server
     hosts: all
     tasks: 
       - name: ping test
         ping:


esc:wq!(enter) to save file


--> ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt



                         ***********Modules***********

System level modules 


==> command modules--> used to execute commands 

==> file--> modules used to copy replace many more 

==> db--> modules used to add remove modify databases

==> cloud--> modules have for amazon,docker, azure ,google,vmware manymore.

==> windows--> modules used to operate in windows environment

and have manymore modules
